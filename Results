System Analysis
● The main advantage of adaptive filters is that the behavior of the
adaptive filter changes depending on the characteristics of the
signal under the filter.
● Least mean squares (LMS) algorithms are a class of adaptive filter
used to mimic a desired filter by finding the filter coefficients that
relate to producing the least mean square of the error signal
(difference between the desired and the actual signal).
● The Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm is familiar and simple to
use for cancellation of noises. However, the low convergence rate
and low signal to noise ratio are the limitations for this LMS
algorithm.
● As we change the step size(mu),the rate of convergence varies
accordingly.It becomes higher with increase in the step size .
● The code used 32 tap filters because it makes the error signal
convergence quicker as compared to 8,16,24 tap lengths. With
increase in tap lengths.
